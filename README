Wordsearch is a solitaire word game.  The goal to achieve a high score
by forming long words.  The board begins filled with letter tiles; on
each turn, find a word reading in a straight line across, backwards,
up, down, or diagonally, and remove the tiles in that word.  You may
also slide tiles in straight lines across empty spaces to form a word.
A word's score is the sum of the tile values times the number of
tiles.  Continue forming words and removing tiles until you can no
longer form a word.  Your total game score is the sum of the word
scores.

Wordsearch is based on the board game of the same name, designed by
Malcolm Goldsmith and Michael Kindred and published by Waddingtons and
Pressman in 1988.
